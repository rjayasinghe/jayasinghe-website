This is my private website. I am not sure yet what I'll publish here. Mostly it
will be nerdy stuff about bicycles and computers. :)

The site has been built with the static site generator [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) and is
hosted at [Netlify](https://netlify.com). If you have ever felt the desire to migrate away
from wordpress and do something more lightweight - get in touch with me. ;)
