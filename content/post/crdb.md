Recently I changed my job from synyx Karlsruhe back to the good old SAP headquarters in Walldorf. Since I slowly ramped down my active project work I had the time to write a longer blog post which was then [hosted at the Cockroach Labs site](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/blog/java-persistence-layer-hibernate/). So, if you're interested in building a application on top of a cloud-native datastore without losing the qualities of a traditional, acid-compliant RDBMs this article is for you. :)
