After a few months with my own NES classic theme I switched to a theme that offers a more readable font for longer texts. Reason is that I actually wrote my first post on this blog and it was awful to read it in this 8-bit style NES font. BTW: the color scheme is solarzied light. I really love that color scheme. It runs on my terminal, my IDEs and everywhere else where it makes sense. ;)
